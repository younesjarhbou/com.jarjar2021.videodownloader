The card-flipping game, known as Ddakji, is a traditional Korean game popular with children. Not dissimilar to pogs, the aim of the game is to throw your card in a manner that flips your opponent’s.

Unlike in Squid Game, which sees the winner win petty cash (or a slap in the face), should you flip your opponent’s card in real life you get to keep said card.

Those who fail to make it across in time are killed.

The twist of the game is that players can only move when the robot has her back turned to the contestants, which they herald by shouting ‘green light’. When the robot shouts red light, and spins around to face the crowd, the contestants all have to freeze. If they are caught moving, or even hesitating, the robot’s motion detectors kick in, and the eyes (which double up as machine guns) shoot to kill (or in some cases, obliterate).

The round is based on the playground game of the same name, but it is also called ‘Statues’ or ‘Grandmother’s Footsteps’ in the UK. In a similar fashion, a person starts out as the “Curator” (It, Granny, Pooh, etc.) and stands at the end of a field. Everyone else playing stands at the far end (distance depends upon playing area selected). The object of the game is for a “Statue” to tag the Curator, thereby becoming the Curator and resetting the game.",

When purchasing the candy as a street food, eaters try to trim their way around the outline on the snack without breaking the picture. If they are successful, they receive a second ppopgi for free.

The street food was most popular in South Korea in the 1970s and 80s, but has enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in recent weeks due to Squid Game’s popularity.

What makes Squid Game’s version of the game all the more terrifying (apart from the gun being pointed to your head) is removing the shape from the rest of the honeycomb. While several players try in desperation to chisel their honeycomb shapes out with a toothpick provided to each player, Seong Gi-hun and a select few remaining players devise a more ingenious solution to the game.",

The goal of the game is to overpower the opposing team by pulling on the rope at the same time, dragging them across the dividing line drawn in the centre between the two.

Naturally, in Squid Game the game curators have upped the ante and given the Sports Day favourite a deadly twist.

Participants are chained to the rope, and stand on large platforms over a large, steep drop. If a team is overpowered and loses, they fall into this canyon, right before a guillotine chops the rope in half, sending them plummeting to their imminent death.

We see many of the couples play wagers with their marbles, guessing odds and evens. Jang Deok-su plays a more physical game with his crony – whoever can get the most marbles into a small hole by the end of the round wins all 20 marbles. Meanwhile, Cho Sang-woo tricks his partner Ali into giving him all 20 of his marbles, despite Ali’s steadfast trust in him.

It’s certainly the most heartbreaking round, as many people have partnered up with teammates they thought they could depend on. One emotional twist saw players 069 and 070, a husband and wife couple, pair up only to realise one must kill the other.",
