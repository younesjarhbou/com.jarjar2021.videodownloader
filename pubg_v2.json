          "desc" :"PUBG Mobile Microcosm event is going to be the second event of the current season and will be themed with respect to the Season 19 Traverse Royale Pass. In this event, players will have the ability to transform into mini Insectoids to stay out of sight and travel through wormholes.
          
          Event details
PUBG Mobile Microcosm event will provide five labs across the map of Erangel and each lab will be equipped with interactive facilities which will allow the player to transform into an Insectoid which will also allow one to fly at a low altitude.
The labs will also have their own loot and therefore might become a hot drop for the duration of the event. It will appear in the form of a large imposing building and will bear the name “Inhuman Labs”. It will also come with a slogan which will say “In Truth We Trust”.

Facilities accessible from the Labs
1. Quantum Transformation Device
The basic apparatus of the lab, used to transform into an Insectoid or go back to normal form from an Insectoid. It will be in the shape of a cylindrical apparatus and will be found on a raised platform in the centre of the lab

2. Energy Store
The machine for vending combat supplies to the player in exchange of Luminators. It’ll give players weapons such as ARs and attachments. Each item will have a specific Luminator cost.

3. Wormhole Device
A teleportation device activated by Luminators capable of transporting a player from one lab to another. It is to be noted that the device will be accessible to the player only in the shrunk Insectoid form. Each use of this device is supposed to cost 50 Luminators.
The lab will also showcase some non-interactive enclosures made of glass which will house a variety of insects and animals which have gone a mutation of some sort as a result of all the tests done in the lab.

PUBG Mobile Microcosm event mechanics
Once a player has successfully transformed into an Insectoid, they will be granted access to special weapons exclusive to Insectoids which could be used to engage in fights with other Insectoids. It should be noted that the Insectoids will be invincible to damage from regular ammo types, but will sustain damage when hit with a Pan.

The Insectoids will be equipped with a visual ability which will allow them to spot certain objects called Luminators scattered around the labs upto a certain radius. The Luminators could be exchanged for combat supplies in the Exchange Store or travel from one lab to another by opening a wormhole. The Luminators will be present in the shape of bright yellow orbs floating mid air in the open or in houses.

It is to be noted that the Insectoid form, that is, the shrinked form will be fully sustainable only within a certain radius of the lab called the Quantum Field. If the player exits that Quantum Field or wanders too far off, then the Insectoid form will no longer be sustained and the player will revert back to their original regular sized form. All gear and weapons equipped before turning into an Insectoid will also be returned.

An entirely new type of event, of something whose likes we haven’t seen anytime before, this event has great potential to be a hit among the fans. It might come as a refreshing change to the format of the events with the brand new mechanics and objectives. So brace yourselves, because it’s about to get real hot soon.

          Our PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds tips and survival guide will help keep you alive
          
           
           
           
          
          1. Don’t be afraid to hide out in the blue early on
          
          
          If you want to stay alive then taking damage might not seem like the best idea  but in the early game it can be worth it. If you hide out on the edge of the blue circle you will take small amounts of damage  but no one will expect you to be out there. With some good healing options you can stay there for quite a long time and avoid fights entirely. You may even be able to pick up a few kills on unsuspecting foes. But you always keep an eye on your health and the next circle. 
          
          2. Terrain can be just as good cover as any building or wall
          
          
          Buildings are usually pretty good for staying alive  especially if you can cover the only entrance  but they carry a lot of risks. A well placed grenade will end your run instantly and  if someone knows you are in there  they can just wait by the exit. If you are looking for a good place to hold up for a while  try and find a ridge  dip  or hill so your opponents won’t be able to hit you. This will provide solid cover with better sightlines than a building and  crucially  a lot more escape options. 
          
          3. ALWAYS take a level three helmet...
          
          
          If you want to win you are going to need a good helmet and vest  so when looting untouched equipment always grab the highest level possible. But if after a fight you find a damaged level three on the person you took down it can be difficult to know what to pick up and what to leave. The general rule here is actually pretty simple. Always take a level three helmet  even if it is close to being destroyed. A level three will always save you from a headshot with the M24  and is the only one that will do so. Therefore it is nearly always worth it. 
          
          4. ...but sometimes leave a level three vest
          
          
          Vests are a little different to helmets in terms of usefulness  but as always an undamaged level three will always be better than a level two. In the late game  if you plan to take a lot of fights then better durability is more important than high level. So a full health level two is better than a quarter health level three  as it will last longer. If it’s down to the last few people  though  then the damaged level three should be the better option  as blocking more damage from one shot could be the difference between a win and a loss.
          
          5. Play the edge of the circle
          
          
          Once you start to hit the late game  different strategies start to come into play. The one that should keep you alive is to play on the edge of the circle and to run in with it. Staying on the edge means that the area you need to be aware of shrinks a lot. You know that a big portion of what's behind you is totally safe  so you only need to be aware of what is in front of you. If you're in the middle then you have to keep eyes everywhere  which is not an easy task. 
          
          6. Keep yourself boosted up late game
          
          
          Even if you are at full health  once it gets down to the last 15 or so people it is a good idea to start popping those energy drinks and painkillers to get you boosted up and regenerating health. There’s a few reasons for this  such as not having to worry about it after a late game fight  as well as the potential that one tick of health recovery could win you a close battle. Either way  if you have them available you should get the boosts going early as there's no point saving them. Who wants painkillers with a chicken dinner?
          
          
          7. Hiding in bushes works surprisingly well
          
          
          This sounds crazy  but bushes actually provide a really good stealth option. Sit in a bush and there is a strong chance someone will walk straight past and then wonder where on earth they got shot from. Bushes provide no hard cover  but if no one sees you then no one will shoot you  and if no one shoots you then you won't die. Although perhaps take off any bright coloured clothes you have on before trying it.
          
          8. Grass is not visible after a while so don’t hide in it
          Advertisement
          
          
          
          With the right scopes and sightlines  you can see for hundreds of meters in PUBG  but crucially grass stops being visible at around the 200m mark. This means that if someone decides to lay down  they may think they are well covered  but anyone more than 200 meters away can see them clearly. You are always much better trying to find hard cover like a tree or wall (or even getting in a bush) than trying to lay down in the grass until the late stages. This also means that hitting the deck in a field when shots come in is a terrible idea. Just run to cover instantly. 
          
          9. Pick. Your. Battles 
          
          
          Everyone wants to be the person that racks up 20 kills and walks out the victor  but the chances of that happening are pretty slim. (Unless you're Shroud or Dr Disrespect  two of the biggest PUBG streamers who somehow manage to get more kills in one round than most do in an evening.) So in order to stay alive you should pick your battles. That’s not to say you shouldn’t take any fights  but only pick battles you know you can win. If you spot someone holding an AWM and full level three armour  maybe don’t take them on in clear sight. But see someone with just a shotgun while you have a 4x AR and you should totally take them out. Take an extra second to evaluate each combat situation and if it looks tough  maybe run the other way.
