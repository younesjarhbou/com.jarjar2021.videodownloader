If you're ever in a situation where you see a police car with its lights on, it's important to stay calm and move to the side of the road if you're in a car or stay out of the way if you're on foot. The police car might be responding to an emergency, and they need to get to the scene quickly and safely."

That means being kind to others, respecting rules, and treating everyone with respect. If you ever see something that doesn't look right or if you're in trouble, don't hesitate to tell a grown-up you trust, like a parent, teacher, or another police officer. We all work together to keep our community safe and happy."
